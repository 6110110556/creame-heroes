## Appearance
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Coco has white colored fur with big sky blue eyes. He is the third most fluffiest cat after Chuchu. He has fluffy fur and a fluffy tail. He also bears a strong resemblance to Lala, which makes many people think that the two are siblings, though they actually aren't. Unlike Lala, he has a slightly different eye shape and is NOT a munchkin cat (unlike Lala, which is a munchkin). Lala also has a small dark spot on her nose, while Coco does not.ㅤ

Due to such a huge coat of fur, many people may think that he is fat, though in reality he is actually quite slim, as seen whenever Ms. Claire bathes him.

## Personality
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Coco usually appears to be very calm, as stated by Ms. Claire. In the past he was a mischievous cat like Momo. He also had a slight rivalry with Momo, as the two often got into fights. Coco dislikes food with strange smells, even making a face when Claire moved the strange food closer to him. It is stated by Claire to be one of the more timid cats, as he easily got nervous and uncomfortable when she took him to a vet. When being voiced by her, his dialogues always begin with the word “Hmm”, making him sound like he is closely examining the objects or situations as a doctor would.

Coco appears very little on screen as Ms. Claire stated that he hates the camera for unclear reasons. His pupils would swell up when the camera is brought near to him and he even punches it before running away. Sometimes, he does let the camera film him, but only for a short time. Recently, he is more accepting to the camera, and is featured in Claire's videos more often.

Coco is not vocal at all and has only meowed in 2 videos. Coco also has the same voice like Claire in talking.

Coco has good relations with all the cats except for Lulu. He and Momo are best friends. He likes to sit beside DD and they have a brotherly bond. TT rarely ever hits him. Lala sees him as a big brother and is comfortable beside him. He cares for ChuChu as seen when they had moved to a new house, Coco had come to see if ChuChu was in her tent or not. He also likes Nana as he was grooming her once. He also gets along well with Toto and Dodo.

Coco is the only adult male cat who doesn't have any romantic relationship with a female cat￼,unlike Momo and Lala, or DD and TT; Lulu and ChuChu

## History
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

At one point, Coco was adopted by Ms. Claire alongside Momo when the two were kittens. Coco grew up to be a trouble-making and naughty teenager. However, with time, Coco lost his mischievous personality and became calm and nice, a thing which made Claire both happy and sad at the same time. Coco became close to Momo but they also became rivals at the same time.
