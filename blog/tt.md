## Appearance
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

TT is a tall, queenly cat with short, greyish-silver fur and sad olive-green eyes. She also has dark grey markings across her fur, which is seen on her head as well. She has a yellow spot on top of her nose. TT has a scar on her right eye due to having Feline Herpes when she was kitten, which is why her eye appears cloudy. As a kitten, TT was very skinny with a black pattern across the bridge of her nose, which indicated how very sick she was.

## Personality
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

TT is the eldest female cat and the may be the eldest among all of the cats judging by how she exerts her dominance around her siblings. She has a motherly and older sibling like attitude towards them. Fans still don’t know who is the older cat between DD and TT. Some say DD is older because he was adopted first.She is very loyal to Ms. Claire since she raised her from kittenhood. You can even say she has the closest bond with her owner.

It is important to note that she is very sensitive. When Lulu ruined Claire's carpet and Claire thought TT had done it, TT began to wag her tail in anger and sulked for some time. She gets jealous easily as well, which is one of the reasons she punches the other cats. However, the main reason is when they get too close or bump into her. She never actually deals real damage however. Those who are concerned for her behavior do not need to worry. If she was actually hurting the other cats, Claire would do something about it.

TT can understand human language, as she understands Claire's words. She is very patient as well, as seen when Momo and Coco accidentally hit her while fighting, she was patient enough to not fight back. She is also a very well-mannered lady and waits for her food unlike her fellow cats.

She also gets upset easily when she sees unknown people or animals; for example, when Ms. Claire brought her to the vet and they met the doctor, TT was very nervous. TT often starts to hiss at him, even though they have gone to the vet several times due to her kidney failure. To make it up to her, Ms. Claire gives TT a treat, but she still seems to be angry and hisses, especially during an injection. TT would also growl until she got another treat.

She is a big fan of the cat wheel and is one of the 2 cats who uses it. The other being Lala.
