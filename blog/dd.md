## Appearance
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

DD is the fluffiest and tallest among all the cats. He has long, creamy brown and white fur. He has bright yellow eyes. Due to such a huge coat of fur, many people may think that he is fat, though in reality he is actually quite slim, as seen whenever Ms. Claire bathes him.

## Personality
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

DD the eldest cat that Claire owns, thus having a fatherly and older sibling like attitude towards the other cats. He is calm, and always displays a very parental behavior towards Lala. He is kind to the other cats as well, and close to TT because he has been with her since they were both kittens. DD was shown multiple times to be very smart, and is very fond of boxes. He also loves pushing things off tables and counter tops such as bread. He is the only one who knows how to open cupboards and drawers. Due his innocence, he never fights back when TT punches him, even when she hit him in the eye. Despite being calm most of the time, DD can lose his patience. He once fought back when Lulu attacked him. Aside from that, he is the definition of a gentle giant. Over time, DD and TT have matured much more than their fellow cats. This is proven when instead of panicking, he patiently allows his owner Claire to cut his claws. He also seems to have gotten used to getting bathed, as when instead of running away like the other cats when Claire bathed him, he patiently waited in the bath tub for Claire to rinse his fur, and didn't panic once although his pupils had swelled up and he had a rather grim expression on his face. DD's meow is a soft and quiet chatter. DD only meowed once with a crying sobbing voice in the shower. CoCo has zero and MoMo in his midst early pre prime post experience season had few meowing/screaming moments in the shower.

DD seems to have grown territorial over his owner and his home. He hisses at any machine or toy which looks like a cat. When Claire petted a hospital cat and allowed DD to smell her hand. DD hissed twice. Later when being examined by the doctor, DD hissed even louder than beforehand. Beforehand, DD is the king.
