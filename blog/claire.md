## Appearance
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Claire is the human friend and owner of the ten CreamHeroes. She has straight brown hair. She doesn't want the channel to be focused on her face, but rather her ten cats. She even has a friend named Ju-in, who has a Youtube channel with his two cats, Ari and Rirang.

## Personality
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Claire is very kind and caring to her cats and treats them very nicely, having raised most of her cats from kittenhood. This is why every cat is very loyal to her in return. She is also very amiable. Claire even revealed half of her face in her vlogging videos.

## History
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Among the ten cats, the first cats that Ms. butler met were DD and TT, who were raised by the company where the butler worked. At some point, the company adopted Coco and Momo additionally. And in the meantime, Ms. Butler adopted three cats she would personally raise: Lulu, Lala, and Chuchu. But things got worse, and the company could no longer raise DD, TT, Coco, and Momo. The company asked the butler for help, and for complex reasons, the butler took over the company, while bringing DD, TT, Coco and Momo into the butler's possession. So she came to live with seven cats.

Previously, this wiki said Ms. butler had lost her job when she met ChuChu, but that's not true. She was just feeling skeptical about her job. Details of her first meeting with Chuchu can be found in her video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub82Xb1C8os

In spring 2020, Ms. butler fostered a mother cat and her 2 kittens since the family was facing euthanasia at a shelter she volunteered at.. On the 7th of August she annouced she would keep them, calling the mother cat Nana and the kittens Toto and Dodo
