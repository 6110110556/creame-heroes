## Appearance
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Lulu is a brown-coated cat with a white muzzle. He has yellow-golden eyes. If you look closely, you can see he has an M forehead mark, along with Momo, TT and Chuchu. He has dark-colored paws and unlike the other cats, he has a bushy raccoon-shaped tail. he also has short legs due to his father and mother being a munchkin, british shorthair, and scottish fold.

## Personality
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

He is the most mischievous of all Claire's cats, taking after previous troublemaker Momo. He is a glutton, lunging for whatever treats he can find. He is always very hungry, often meowing loud to ask Claire for treats. He often kicks out the other cats out of their comfortable spots, most notably, Coco and Momo. However, this does not include Chuchu, with whom he has a very close relationship, and is usually seen grooming her lovingly and sitting with her. He also grooms the other cats occasionally, mostly Momo. However, while Lulu is gentle with the other cats, Momo most often dislikes getting groomed by him since Lulu usually grooms him to hard when he does ask to be groomed, which usually ends up resulting in a fight between the two which Momo has shown to feel bad whenever he fights Lulu. He often bites toys intensely during games, mostly dragonfly toys which are hard to pull free since Lulu has a strong grip with his teeth. Claire usually tells him to let go of it and gives him a treat so she can pull the toy away from him. However, once Lulu was unwilling to let go and tried to gobble up the treat with the toy still in his mouth, finally letting go. Before he bites the toy, his pupils starts to swell up tremendously when he sees it. He also shown to have an aggressiveness towards other cats which he does not know, like Sharon, as seen in one of the videos where Ms. Claire brings Lulu to the vet. Sharon shows up, and Lulu begins to growl nervously, hissing at her. His eyes started to swell up when meeting her due to his nervousness, but Claire told Lulu that he is a customer and other cats (Like Sharon and Dong-E) are not his enemies. Lulu hates being touched too much, such as getting his claws trimmed or ears cleaned, so he growls and tries to run away. Chuchu and Momo is the only one he allows to share his comfortable spots with, and on some occasions. However, Momo himself does not like sharing with Lulu unlike Chuchu who doesn't mind as much.

Although Lulu likes to eat, he refuses to eat meals that look scary, like a big prawn or an octopus. Lulu often takes great pride to pick fights with other cats which usually happens If they prevoke him or if he's very energetic but he usually loses the fights because he's smaller than the other cats.

## History
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

At one point in his life, Lulu was adopted by Ms. Claire as a kitten. Lulu was the youngest of the seven cats which Claire had adopted, being 10 days younger than Lala and 30 days younger than Chuchu. He was usually very sleepy and spent most of his time sleeping, which is why it was very easy for Claire to clean his ears and trim his claws. He was calm and didn't panic as he currently does when she did so. Lulu was also not a trouble-making, hungry cat as he is now.

As he grew a little older and close to Chuchu and Lala, he developed rivalry with a young Momo and the two often wrestled and fought despite Lulu still being a kitten. When Lulu was once drinking water from a very high plastic box, Momo approached him and tried to push him in, but pulled him down as he realized that it could be dangerous. As Lulu tried to drink the water again, Momo pinned him to the ground and didn't allow him to drink water even though it wasn't dangerous anymore.

With time, Lulu replaced Momo as the top trouble-making cat. Lulu's appetite grew tremendously despite receiving full meals. He began to eat things other than food, such as chewing and almost biting off pieces of furniture, and chewing on anything that has food in through.
