## Appearance
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Chuchu is a fluffy longhaired cat with a quad-colored calico coat. She has bright yellow eyes with dark pupils. She also has a slightly smushed appearance to her face, much like Momo. She has a few dark brown, thin stripes on her forehead, small, folded ears and has a short, fluffy tail. She is also tall, slightly taller than both Lulu and Lala. She overall has more of a white fur color. She has an "M" on her forehead, much like Momo and Lulu. Her fur colors are brown, orange, white, and least noticable; black.

## Personality
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Chuchu is the most timid cat. She is one of the youngest among the cats, and has a very innocent behavior. She is very close to Ms. Claire, and once when she pretended to die, Chuchu was the one who showed the most concern for her owner, getting upset at the mere sight of it. Chuchu usually prefers to just sit around, does not take part in most of the games, and is very calm, though she can get frightened easily. As Chuchu grows older, she starts becoming more active and playful. Claire stated that in the beginning when Chuchu was just a kitten, she was extremely hard to get close to since she was very shy and got frightened very easily. Chuchu does care for everyone around her, as seen with her meek behavior.

Recently, Chuchu’s personality has changed slightly: she expresses her feelings more clearly, actively participates in all of the activities, quickly attacks the toys, and has developed a more mature and less shy personality, which Claire stated is very similar to Lulu. She is one of the least food motivated cats in the house, although she is occasionally shown begging for food. These days, ChuChu has became fierce, as you can see on one of Creamheroes's videos.

## History
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

In Chuchu's birthday video (December 25th), it was revealed that Chuchu was abandoned as a kitten, not once, but twice, which might have caused her to become so shy and easily scared. Ms. Claire made Christmas Day Chuchu's birthday, since Chuchu 's actual birthday is unknown, because she wanted Chuchu's birthday to be the day when everyone is happy and cheerful. She was also abused by her 2 owners, so the owners felt guilty and abandoned her, so Chuchu wasn't really a playful cat. When Claire was in a depressed mood from being skeptical about her job, she received a message about a kitten who needed to be adopted. Claire rushed over to the man who was currently taking care of the kitten. When Claire asked the man about the kitten, he held out his hand. On his hand, there was a small bundle of fur. That day, that tiny fur ball became Claire's cat Chuchu. Chuchu helped her recover from her stress and gave her hope, which is why Claire calls her a "Hero" as well.
