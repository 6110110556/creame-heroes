## Appearance
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Lala is an Napoleon Munchkin cat with a long white fur coat. She may look similar to Coco but the two aren’t identical. Lala has bright blue eyes and a black blotch on her nose while Coco doesn’t and like a Munchkin, she also has short legs, and she tends to stick her tail straight up. Lala also has 2 fur patches on both of her eyes which when she faces forward, she looks angry.

## Personality
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Lala, like Lulu, is a very mischievous cat. She is hungry most of the time and even runs to quickly get the food. She also hates to be bathed, always trying to run away and meowing very loudly. She is also very close to DD, often following and copying what the older cat does. It is hinted that Lala prefers to be groomed by other cats, mostly DD, or at times, Lulu.

Lala is a big fan of the cat wheel and is one of the 2 cats who uses it with TT. She is very athletic and goes very fast on the wheel. LaLa can sometimes even be seen sitting by the wheel waiting her turn when TT is using it.

However, despite being mischievous most of the time, Lala, like TT, sometimes has a habit of punching or biting other cats whenever they bumping or getting too close to her, noticeably those she dislikes such as Momo and Dodo.

## History
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

When Lala was a very young cat, she was adopted by Ms. Claire at some point, alongside Lulu. She quickly grew close to Lulu due to their same age and similar interests. TT took a liking to her and often groomed her, sometimes against the cat's will. However, TT also seemed to get fed up with kitten LaLa at times, such as when TT punched LaLa as she was trying to drink some water. When Lala wanted someone to groom her, she approached DD, though was a bit afraid since DD was a huge cat. However, when the sleeping DD woke up, he didn't get angry at her for disturbing him, instead beginning to groom her. That's when the two grew close and DD became a father figure for Lala.
