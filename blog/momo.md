## Appearance
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Momo has ginger/orange fur and yellowish eyes. Unlike the other cats, Momo’s facial features are slightly different, making his face look a bit grumpy when seen closely, due to him being an Exotic Shorthair. According to Ms. Claire, he is very soft and when receiving an injection in a cat hospital, she had to hold him tightly as he could easily slip away. He is also very tall and long, as seen when he was stretched during an X-ray at the hospital. Despite this, he is rather stocky built, with a roundish face. MoMo's meow is a soft and loud 'mrowow'.

Claire also possesses some Momo plush toys which are seen with a McDonald’s “M” mark on the forehead where Momo has a similar “M” mark.

## Personality
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Momo is portrayed as slightly old fashioned in the videos. He is quite calm most of the time, though in the past he was the mischievous cat until Lulu grew up. When he was younger, Momo was a very mischievous cat, but he mellowed out as he got older. Momo, when voiced by Ms. Claire, has expressed dislike when the younger cats do not respect him, especially Lulu, despite the fact that he is younger than DD and TT. Momo is shown to dislike being groomed by others at times, walking away when DD groomed him too much. Also, one day he even lashed out at Lulu when he groomed him and kicked him out of the place they were sitting in. Momo occasionally gets into fights with Coco due to their slight rivalry. According to Claire, Momo thinks too much before doing something in the games she arranges for the cats, getting confused to the point that he even stops what he is doing. While receiving an injection, he was very nervous and uncomfortable. He also feels uncomfortable when getting his claws trimmed. He is one of the most energetic cats in the house, hence his catchphrase. He loves playing with toys so much he gets extremely defensive over them, hissing at Lulu when he was playing with a mouse toy, and growling and hissing at Nana, Toto, and Dodo when he played with a felt ball.

Momo, despite his sibling rivalry with Lulu, has shown to secretly care for him, as he is often shown to avoid situations which may result in a fight. Once when he did get into a serious fight with Lulu which resulted in Lulu’s loss of some fur, he was later shown sitting in a very awkward and stiff position and had a very guilty expression on his face. Once when DD opened a packet of food, Momo did eat a tiny portion of it, and felt guilty to the point of not coming to eat his dinner that day.

Despite their rivalry, Momo and Coco have a strong bond, and patiently let each other take turns while playing when any toy.

He seems to have a good sense of balance and athleticism, as he is shown to leap high and reach places that the other cats don't or won't go.
