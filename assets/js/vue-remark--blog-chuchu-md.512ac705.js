When Claire was in a depressed mood from being skeptical about her job, she received a message about a kitten who needed to be adopted. Claire rushed over to the man who was currently taking care of the kitten. When Claire asked the man about the kitten, he held out his hand. On his hand, there was a small bundle of fur.
