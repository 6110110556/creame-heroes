DD was shown multiple times to be very smart, and is very fond of boxes. He also loves pushing things off tables and counter tops such as bread. He is the only one who knows how to open cupboards and drawers. Due his innocence, he never fights back when TT punches him, even when she hit him in the eye. Despite being calm most of the time, DD can lose his patience. He once fought back when Lulu attacked him. Aside from that, he is the definition of a gentle giant. Over time, DD and TT have matured much more than their fellow cats. This is proven when instead of panicking, he patiently allows his owner Claire to cut his claws. He also seems to have gotten used to getting bathed, as when instead of running away like the other cats when Claire bathed him, he patiently waited in the bath tub for Claire to rinse his fur, and didn't panic once although his pupils had swelled up and he had a rather grim expression on his face.
